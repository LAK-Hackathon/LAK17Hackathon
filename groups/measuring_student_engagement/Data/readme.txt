x1.x2.x3.x4.x5.x6

x1 : A - means activity, not test
x2 = lessonID
x3 = activityID
x4 = datasetNumber
x5 = itemIdentifier
x6 = how much question is worth?


In the large sparse matrix, the rows with the negative key values represent dummy data that was to populate activities that had insufficient data for the sample.

The student IDs don't necessarily correlate across the files (due to de-identifying the data), but pretending that they do might be interesting for analysis anyway.
