# Student Interview notes 3/14/2017

Tell me about something you have learned? Very difficult to identify gaps in ones own knowledge. Illusion of knowing.
Would you share anything you've accomplished with others outside the university? References a group project that solved some chemistry issue.
Would a digital record help you in anyway? Yes, mostly by fostering self-reflection and awareness of accomplishments. Potentially also a "conversation starter" with employers about activities that are relevant to certain positions. Concerned about matching simply based on "keywords"
How could this work better? Believes that the employer would need to also be aware of the competencies and skills needed.
