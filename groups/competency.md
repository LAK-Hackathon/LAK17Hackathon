# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Students and employers can not regularly document, assemble, or share their needs or achievements relative to competency frameworks. For example, teachers' assessments could provide more value to students and others if better understood. Empowering teachers to articulate associations with competency frameworks is a valuable step toward more meaningful digital credentials.

# Competency Framework Story Spine
Once upon a time... I enrolled in an Educational Psychology program to study how people use their knowledge
and every day .. I read and read and I wrote and wrote
until one day .. I graduated
and because of that ... I applied for jobs
and because of that ... I worked to communicate what I learned relative to what was expected
and because of that ... I got frustrated
until finally ... I decided we needed a better system
and since that day ... I have joined with others to build a better ecosystem to connect education and employment
and the moral of the story is ... students need help understanding their educational experience and in communicating it to others.
