# LAK17 Hackathon Groups Space

The group naming is somewhat accidental!

There is a general Slack channel HTML dump and folders for the four groups

## Group 1
Making Analytics Safe for Students (student-facing issues)

See issue #7 - https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/LAK17Hackathon/issues/7

For technical output see the separate repository https://github.com/provpup/safeviz

Also the group1 folder for a mockup "student analytics reflective planner" and the log of the group's Slack channel, which contains much of the technical dialogue. There are also the csv files of simulated data and a flip chart photograph.

## Competency
See issue #8 https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/LAK17Hackathon/issues/8

## Group 3
Contains data simualtion code, xapi templates, a Slack channel log and notes on video playback analytics.

## Dashboard
See issue #22 https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/LAK17Hackathon/issues/22

Powerpoint file in the dashboard folder outlines the challenge.
